## What is it? 

The Emergency project is a tool for processing real time 911 fire and medical data within the city of Seattle.  The city provides a well formatted, continuously updated HTML document containing real time dispatch data.  This application seeks to accomplish two things with this data.  First, to collect, process, and store all incoming dispatch events.  Second, to present meaningful representations of this data to allow primarily the public and possibly the relevant decision makers to analyze and understand this information
